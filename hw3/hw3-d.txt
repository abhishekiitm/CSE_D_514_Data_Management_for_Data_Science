The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data centers. 
What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud? 
What do you consider the benefits or drawbacks to this approach compared to running the database locally?

I think DBMS as part of a public cloud is a really convenient way to set up a project. 
It abstracts away the physical infrastructure so developers don't have to worry about the hardware and can focus on writing the software.

Public cloud storage vs local database:
- It's easier to scale your database by choosing configurations suitable to one's needs. Scaling is comparatively tougher in a local database system 
as one would need to buy computing resources
- For small projects, cloud offerings are convenient as you don't have to worry about the physical infrastructure
- For larger projects, the cost of using public cloud could be much higher and it may be cheaper to use a local database system
- Setting up a local database system can be more challenging than using a plug and play solution from the cloud
- Public clouds offer redundancy which have much better backup gaurantees compared to a local database
- Public clouds also make it easier to access your database across the internet, whereas, you would have to configure the connectivity of the local/on-premise database
- Public clouds are really convenient for smaller teams and can help improve the productivity of software teams as developers don't have to worry about the hardware.
- You lose control over the availability and security of the database which could be an issue for highly critical systems.
